# Add to Attio — Product Brief

## Overview

**Add to Attio** is a minimal browser extension that lets users add people to Attio directly from high-signal social surfaces, at the moment relationships actually begin.

It is intentionally narrow in scope, transparent by design, and optimized for operators who want speed, trust, and zero UI friction.

The core product is open source. Optional hosted services may exist, but are not required for the tool to function.

---

## Problem

Most CRM "capture" tools are overbuilt.

They attempt to support too many CRMs, too many surfaces, and too many workflows at once. The result is noisy UI, hidden behavior, artificial usage limits, and tools that actively get in the way of how operators actually work.

At the same time, the most important relationships start before email or calendar activity, on social platforms where intent and context are visible early.

There is a gap between where relationships begin and where CRMs typically start tracking them.

---

## Product Goal

Enable fast, trustworthy capture of people into Attio from the places where business relationships originate, without forcing users to adopt new workflows or tolerate UI pollution.

Add to Attio should feel like a natural extension of the browser, not a platform.

---

## Core Principles

- **Single-focus integration**
  The product supports Attio only. There is no attempt to generalize across CRMs.

- **Capture early**
  The tool operates on social surfaces, before email or calendar interaction exists.

- **Minimal UI**
  No overlays, pins, side panels, or persistent interface elements.

- **Transparent behavior**
  No hidden enrichment, no background scraping, no data usage that cannot be inspected.

- **Fair usage**
  Daily limits are preferred over monthly credit systems to encourage habitual use.

- **Dogfooded first**
  The tool is built for real, daily use by its author before anything else.

---

## Supported Surfaces (Initial)

- LinkedIn
- X (Twitter)
- Reddit

These platforms were selected because they represent the highest signal sources for professional relationships and early intent.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

Add to Attio is not intended to:

- Replace Attio's native email or calendar ingestion
- Inject UI into email clients
- Perform automatic enrichment or contact discovery
- Provide analytics, dashboards, or workflow automation
- Act as a general-purpose CRM abstraction layer
- Automate outreach or communication

Anything that compromises trust, clarity, or focus is out of scope.

---

## Core Functionality

From a supported surface, the user can take a single action to add the person they are viewing to Attio.

The tool captures only what is visible and relevant at the moment of interaction and does not perform any background activity outside of the user's explicit action.

Success and failure feedback is immediate and unobtrusive.

---

## Open Source Posture

The core extension is open source to:

- Build trust in browser-level permissions
- Make behavior inspectable and auditable
- Differentiate clearly from opaque competitors
- Serve as a durable public portfolio artifact

The open source version is fully functional and not artificially crippled.

---

## Optional Hosted Services

Hosted services may exist to support optional capabilities such as:

- Fair usage limits
- Organization and tagging helpers
- Source context metadata
- Convenience features for power users

These services are opt-in and not required to use the core product.

---

## Monetization (Optional)

If monetization exists, it is expected to be:

- Simple
- Transparent
- Based on usage rather than feature lock-in

The product is not dependent on monetization to be successful.

---

## Success Criteria

Add to Attio is successful if:

- It replaces paid, bloated alternatives
- It is used daily without friction
- It never surprises users with hidden behavior
- It remains easy to explain in one sentence
- It stands as a credible example of product judgment and restraint

---

## Positioning

Add to Attio is not a CRM.

It is a precise utility for capturing relationships where they begin, and handing them off cleanly to Attio without getting in the way.
